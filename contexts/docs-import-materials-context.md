# docs/import-materials Context

## Current Status
- Current branch: docs/import-materials
- Started: <!-- START_DATE -->
- Progress: Not started - ready for document import and organization

## Scope Boundaries
- Primary Purpose: Import, organize, and inventory documentation from untracked sources
- In Scope:
  - Collecting documents from untracked sources
  - Creating an inventory of available documentation
  - Moving documents to appropriate locations in the repository
  - Basic organization and linking of documentation
  - Identifying future documentation work needed
- Out of Scope:
  - Creating new standards (only document existing ones)
  - Rewriting or significantly modifying code files
  - Implementing features or fixes
  - Changing project structure beyond documentation organization
  - Making architectural decisions about the project
- Dependencies:
  - Should be one of the first branches created after repository initialization
  - Does not depend on other feature branches

## Completed Work
<!-- None yet -->

## Current Tasks
- [ ] **Document Collection**
  - Create `untracked/source_materials` directory for source documents
  - Use `open untracked/source_materials` command to help user open the folder
  - Wait for user confirmation that files have been added
  - Import documents from existing sources
  - Document origins and sources
  - Organize by preliminary categories

- [ ] **Document Inventory**
  - Create document inventory in markdown table
  - Record metadata for each document (status, purpose, completeness)
  - Identify documentation gaps
  - Prioritize documents for processing

- [ ] **Basic Documentation Organization**
  - Evaluate appropriate structure for this specific project
  - Create documentation directory structure
  - Move documents to appropriate locations
  - Update references between documents

- [ ] **Future Work Identification**
  - Create list of documentation tasks needed in future branches
  - Document remaining work in WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md
  - Suggest future branch contexts for specific documentation improvements
  - Prepare branch for PR

## Notes
### Documentation Structure Options
#### Simple Structure
```
docs/
└── *.md           # All documentation files in single directory
```

#### Comprehensive Structure
```
docs/
├── api/           # API documentation
├── development/   # Development guides
├── usage/         # Usage tutorials
├── reference/     # Reference documentation
└── media/         # Images and other media
```

### Important Guidelines
- This branch focuses ONLY on organizing existing documentation
- Do NOT rewrite scripts or create standards before project definition
- Focus on minimal effective organization without over-engineering
- Mark document status (draft, WIP, complete) but don't extensively rewrite
- If major content changes are needed, note them for future branches

## Error Recovery
- If scope expands beyond documentation: Create new branch for that work
- If documentation requires significant rewriting: Note as future work
- If uncertain about document categorization: Use simple structure initially

## Restart Instructions
To continue this work:
```bash
claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is docs/import-materials, load appropriate context, and continue working on documentation import and organization"
```

<!-- When ready to create PR for this branch:
```bash
claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is docs/import-materials, and create a PR to merge into main"
```
