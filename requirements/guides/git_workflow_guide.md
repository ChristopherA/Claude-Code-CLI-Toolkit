## Essential Git Commands

```bash
# Check status
git status                     # Show current branch and changes
git branch --show-current      # Show only current branch name
git diff --staged              # View staged changes before commit

# Branch operations
git checkout main              # Switch to main branch
git pull                       # Get latest changes
git checkout -b feature/name   # Create new branch
git branch -a                  # List all branches

# Commit workflow
git add file.js                # Stage specific file
git add .                      # Stage all changes (use carefully)
git commit -S -s -m "Message"  # Create signed commit
git push -u origin branch-name # Push new branch
git push                       # Push existing branch
```

<!-- Note for Claude: When helping users with Git operations, always guide them through these specific commands rather than suggesting alternatives that might not follow the project's established practices -->

## Branch Types

| Type | Purpose | Naming | Example |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| feature | New functionality | feature/name | feature/login |
| fix | Bug fixes | fix/description | fix/header-alignment |
| docs | Documentation | docs/area | docs/api-reference |

## Commit Standards

Every commit must:

1. **Be signed** with SSH/GPG keys using `-S` flag
2. **Include DCO sign-off** using `-s` flag
3. **Follow standard message format** (see below)
4. **Be logically atomic** (one conceptual change per commit)

```bash
git commit -S -s -m "Add user authentication feature" -m "- Implement login form
- Add validation logic"
```

## Commit Message Format

Commit messages MUST follow this format:

```
Add feature X                  # First line: Brief summary in present tense (50 chars max)
                               # Second line: Blank
- Implement login component    # Body: Bullet points of key changes (if needed)
- Add form validation          # Keep each bullet concise and focused
- Create authentication service
```

### Commit Message Requirements

1. **First line must be**:
   - Present tense (Add/Fix/Update, not Added/Fixed/Updated)
   - Maximum 50 characters
   - Descriptive but concise
   - No periods at the end

2. **Body (if needed)**:
   - Separated from summary by blank line
   - Bullet points for complex changes
   - Explain what and why, not how
   - No references to AI assistance

### Logical Atomicity

Commits should represent a single logical change:

1. **Single purpose** - Each commit should do exactly one thing
2. **File cohesion** - Typically involves related files for one feature/fix
3. **Separate unrelated changes** - Create multiple commits for unrelated changes
4. **Reviewable** - Small enough to be easily reviewed

## Context-Integrated Workflows

All Git operations MUST be synchronized with context file management. Every branch MUST have a corresponding context file that is kept up-to-date.

### Feature Development

```bash
# Start feature branch with context
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/login

# Create context file immediately after branch creation
# Claude will help with this:
claude "load CLAUDE.md, create context file for branch feature/login, and begin work"

# Make changes and update context before committing
# 1. Update context file with progress
# 2. Stage context file along with code changes
git add contexts/feature-login-context.md
git add src/components/Login.js
git commit -S -s -m "Add login component"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/login
# Update context file with PR readiness before creating PR
claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is feature/login, update context for PR creation, and create PR"
```

### Bug Fixing

```bash
# Start fix branch with context
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b fix/header-alignment

# Create context file immediately after branch creation
claude "load CLAUDE.md, create context file for branch fix/header-alignment, and begin work"

# Make changes and update context before committing
# 1. Update context file with reproduction steps and fix approach
# 2. Stage context file along with code changes
git add contexts/fix-header-alignment-context.md
git add src/components/Header.css
git commit -S -s -m "Fix header alignment on mobile"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin fix/header-alignment
# Update context file with PR readiness before creating PR
claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is fix/header-alignment, update context for PR creation, and create PR"
```

### Documentation Updates

```bash
# Start docs branch with context
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b docs/api-reference

# Create context file immediately after branch creation
claude "load CLAUDE.md, create context file for branch docs/api-reference, and begin work"

# Make changes and update context before committing
# 1. Update context file with documentation changes
# 2. Stage context file along with documentation changes
git add contexts/docs-api-reference-context.md
git add docs/api.md
git commit -S -s -m "Add API reference documentation"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin docs/api-reference
# Update context file with PR readiness before creating PR
claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is docs/api-reference, update context for PR creation, and create PR"
```

3. **Comprehensive PR Description**
   Claude will help create a PR by extracting detailed information from your context file to build a comprehensive PR description. When Claude helps create a PR, it should:
   
   - Extract the purpose and scope from context boundaries
   - Use completed work items as the basis for key improvements
   - Reference specific file changes and justifications
   - Note future work items identified during implementation
   - Include testing approaches based on the context
   
   The PR should use the HEREDOC approach shown above for proper formatting, and follow this structure:
   ```
   ## Summary
   A concise 2-3 sentence explanation of what this PR accomplishes and why it matters.
   Focus on the value delivered, not just what was changed.

   ```

## Safety Tips

- Always check which branch you're on before making changes
- Review changes before committing (`git diff --staged`)
- Never force push to main branch
- Keep commits focused on single logical changes
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Test changes before pushing

<!-- Note for Claude: When helping users with Git operations, emphasize these safety practices, especially verifying the current branch and reviewing changes before committing -->

## Context File Lifecycle Management

Context files track the state of each branch and must be managed throughout the branch lifecycle:

### Context Creation

Always create a context file when creating a new branch:

```bash
# After creating branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
claude "load CLAUDE.md, create context file for branch feature/new-feature, and begin work"
```

### Context Updates

Update the context file before making Git commits:

```bash
# Before committing changes
claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is feature/new-feature, update context with recent changes"

# Include context file in commit
git add contexts/feature-new-feature-context.md
git add [other changed files]
git commit -S -s -m "Implement new feature"
```

### Branch Completion

When a branch is complete and ready for PR:

```bash
# Update context file with completion status
claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is feature/new-feature, mark tasks complete and prepare for PR"

# Include updated context in final commit
git add contexts/feature-new-feature-context.md
git add [other changed files]
git commit -S -s -m "Finalize new feature implementation"
```

### Context Archiving

After a PR is merged, the context can be archived from main branch:

```bash
# Create a temporary branch for archiving
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b housekeeping/archive-contexts

# Archives are stored in docs/archived-contexts
mkdir -p docs/archived-contexts
cp contexts/feature-new-feature-context.md docs/archived-contexts/

# Create PR to archive the context
git add docs/archived-contexts/feature-new-feature-context.md
git commit -S -s -m "Archive completed context for feature/new-feature"
git push -u origin housekeeping/archive-contexts
gh pr create
```

## Special Workflows

### Urgent Main Branch Changes

When branch protection prevents direct commits to main:

```bash
# 1. Create a temporary fix branch WITH CONTEXT
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b fix/urgent-hotfix
claude "load CLAUDE.md, create context file for branch fix/urgent-hotfix, and begin urgent work"

# 2. Make the necessary changes
git add contexts/fix-urgent-hotfix-context.md
git add path/to/files
git commit -S -s -m "Fix urgent issue X"

# 3. Create a temporary PR
git push -u origin fix/urgent-hotfix
claude "load CLAUDE.md, verify current branch is fix/urgent-hotfix, update context for urgent PR, and create PR"

# 4. Request admin review for expedited merge
# Note: Only repository admins can bypass branch protection rules

# 5. After merge, clean up
git checkout main
git pull
git branch -D fix/urgent-hotfix
# Context file will be archived later
```

Key points for urgent changes:
- Always use a branch, even for small changes
- Clearly mark PRs as urgent in the title
- Use the same signing and review standards
- Request admin override only when truly necessary
- Document the emergency process in the PR

### PR Approval and Admin Merge

For PRs requiring admin override of branch protection:

```bash
# Approve the PR (if not your own)
gh pr review <PR-NUMBER> --approve

# Merge with admin override
gh pr merge <PR-NUMBER> --admin --merge

# Verify merge and clean up
git checkout main
git pull
git branch -D feature/branch-name
```

Important notes:
- Use admin merge ONLY when necessary and authorized
- Cannot approve your own PRs (will receive error)
- Document the reason for admin override in PR comments

### Checking PR Status

```bash
# View PR details
gh pr view <PR-NUMBER>

# List all open PRs
gh pr list
```

<!-- Note for Claude: The special workflows section is particularly important for Team development models, but less critical for Solo development. Adjust your guidance based on the project's development model. -->
